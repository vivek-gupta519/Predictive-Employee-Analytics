# Predictive Attrition Analytics

## Introduction
**Predictive Attrition Analytics** is a project designed to analyze and predict employee attrition using various data visualization techniques and machine learning models. The primary goal is to identify the factors that contribute to employee turnover and to provide insights that can help organizations improve retention strategies.

## Objectives
- **Model Employee Attrition**: Develop predictive models to understand and forecast employee attrition rates.
- **Identify Contributing Factors**: Analyze organizational factors that lead to attrition, helping to pinpoint the most significant contributors to turnover.
- **Data Visualization**: Utilize data visualization techniques to present findings in an accessible manner, making it easier for stakeholders to understand the insights.
  
## Command
python -m streamlit run app.py 
## Dataset
The project utilizes a dataset that includes various employee attributes, such as demographics, job roles, performance metrics, and other relevant factors. This data is crucial for discovering patterns and correlations that may indicate potential attrition.

## Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conduct EDA to visualize relationships and trends within the data, helping to inform model selection.
3. **Model Selection**: Implement various machine learning algorithms to predict attrition, such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability in predictions.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Programming Languages**: Python and R for data analysis and modeling.
- **Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for machine learning and data visualization.
- **Deployment**: Consider using platforms like Streamlit for creating interactive dashboards to present the findings.

## Conclusion
The **Predictive Attrition Analytics** project aims to provide organizations with actionable insights into employee turnover. By leveraging machine learning and data visualization, it seeks to enhance understanding of attrition dynamics and support strategic decision-making to improve employee retention.
